## Add a Scheincriteria

To add a criteria click on the "+ New" button in the upper right. A form with two input opens up (see below). Please note that it is possible to add two types of the same criteria however all criterias are linked together with a logic "AND" (therefore the students have to pass _all_ criterias). Make sure that your criterias do not contradict themselfs.

![Criteria form](./assets/criteria_forms/base_criteria_form.png)

1. **Name**: A name for your criteria.

1. **Type**: Select the type of the criteria. Depending on which one you select the rest of the form looks slightly different. You can find a description of all criterias below.

## Change a Scheincriteria

To change a criteria click on the menu icon <IconInText icon={MenuIcon} /> on the right of the row of the criteria. Select "Edit" from the menu that opens up. A dialog pops up which contains a form in which you can change the data of the selected criteria.

:::note
You can **not** change the type of a criteria by editing it.
:::

## Delete a Scheincriteria

To delete a criteria click on the menu icon <IconInText icon={MenuIcon} /> and select "Delete" from the menu. Confirm the prompt asking you if you really want to delete the criteria.

## Criteria Types

There are several criteria types available in the TMS. Each type will be described and it's form will be explained.

:::note Messy Forms
The forms are not as intuitiv as they could be due to the fact that they are automatically generated from the actual TypeScript types. They will get redesigned at some point in the future.

### Attendances

A student has to attend his/her tutorial for a specified amount of times. This can either be an absolute (ie "Student has to visit 5 times") or a percentage (ie "Student has to visit 80% of all times").

### Scheinexam

If there are one or more Scheinexams this criteria defines how they are evaluated. There are basicly two modes:

![Form for the scheinexam criteria](./assets/criteria_forms/scheinexam_criteria.png)

- `All together`: The student needs a certain percentage of all points summed through all scheinexams.

  :::note Example
  You have 2 scheinexams, the first with a total of 30 and the second with a total of 40 points. The percentage needed is 50%. Therefore, the student has to score 35 points in both scheinexams _together_.
  :::

- `Each exam individually`: The students needs a certain percentage of the points in each scheinexam.

  :::note Example
  You have 2 scheinexams, the first with a total of 30 and the second with a total of 40 points. The percentage needed is 50%. Therefore the students has to score 15 points in the first and 20 points in the second exam.
  :::
