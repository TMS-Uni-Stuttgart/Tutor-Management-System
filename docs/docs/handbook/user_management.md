## Provide Credentials

Users need their initial credentials to log in for the first time. There are multiple ways to provide the initial credentials to your users:

- **Send per E-Mail**: By clicking on "Send credentials" all users get an e-mail with their username and initial password. Also, you can send the credentials to a single user only by clicking on the menu button <IconInText icon={MenuIcon} /> on their bar and selecting "Send credentials".

  :::tip Custom E-Mail
  You can customize the e-mail by changing the template used for the mails. For more information read the [_Configuration Page_](../setup/configuration#mail-template) in the server setup.
  :::

  :::note Availability
  These options are only available if the mailing is configured in the [_Settings_](./settings).
  :::

- **Hand out**: By clicking "Print credentials" the TMS generates a PDF with a table containing the usernames and the initial passwords. You could cut out the credentials and hand them to your users.

  :::warning
  The passwords are **clearly readable**! Make sure that only the user gets the credentials belonging to him/her.

## Import Users

To import users from a CSV file click on the "<IconInText icon={GenerateIcon} /> Generate" button in the upper right. A step-by-step wizard will guide you through the import process.

1. **Import CSV content**: Import the CSV content by either copy & paste the content in the input field or by uploading the file. You can upload the file by clicking the "Upload CSV-file" button and the content will be pasted into the input field after uploading. If the separator is not correctly detected on the next page you can change the seperator on _this_ page using the "Separator" input in the upper right.

   :::tip Drag & Drop
   You can also drag & drop the file on the button
   :::

1. **Map Columns**: The TMS tries to find all needed columns automatically. If the columns are not properly detected you can change them through the dropdown menus on this page. The following columns are supported (_required_ ones must be provided):

   - _Firstname (**required**)_: The firstname of the user.

   - _Lastname (**required**)_: The lastname of the user.

   - _E-Mail address (**required**)_: A valid e-mail address of the user. Used to send the credentials to if mailing is configured (see [_Provide Credentials_](#provide-credentials) on this page).

   - _Tutorials_: All tutorials the user holds. Must be a comma-separated list of _Slot names_ of already existing tutorials.
     :::caution Role
     If the user holds tutorials he/she also needs the `TUTOR` role.

     :::caution Role
     If the user corrects tutorials he/she also needs the `CORRECTOR` role.

     :::caution Unique
     If you provide usernames for your users make sure that they are unique.
     :::

   - _Password_: The inital password of the user. If not provided a randomly generated password will be used.

1. **Review User Data**: You can review the users that would be generated by the system. If you need to change information click on the edit button <IconInText icon={EditIcon} />. If you want to reset your changes click on the reset button <IconInText icon={ResetIcon} />.

## Edit User

To edit an user click the menu button <IconInText icon={MenuIcon} /> on their bar and choose "Edit". The form that opens up is the same one as for the process of creating an user ([see above](#create-user)), however, the password field will be blank.

The password of a user will be changed if the password field is **not** empty on editing a user. If it is empty the passwort will be kept.

## Delete User

To delete an user click the menu button <IconInText icon={MenuIcon} /> on their bar and choose "Delete". A confirmation dialog opens up if you really want to delete the user.
