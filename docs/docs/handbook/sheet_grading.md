1. **Sheet Selection**: Select the sheet you want to display and/or edit the gradings of.

1. **Team Card**: Displays the information about the grading for the team. If the students have different gradings a special note is being displayed.

1. **Enter Points**: Click the button to enter points for the complete team. If you want to enter points for a single student of that team click the small arrow icon <IconInText icon={ArrowDownIcon} /> on the right and select "Single for students".

   1. `Dowload PDF(s)`: Download the PDF(s) which belong to the team. If multiple PDFs need to be generated (bc students have different gradings) they are bundled in a ZIP file.

1. **Create PDFs**: Create PDFs for all gradings of this sheet. PDFs are created for each team (if several students of that team have the same grading) and for each student with an individual grading. All created PDFs are bundled in a ZIP file.
